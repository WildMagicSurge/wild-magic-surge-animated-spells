This module is designed to help you set mapping for Wild Magic Surge spell assets for Token Magic FX. It includes a nice, ever-growing sampler of the spell images!

# Using the Module
The module requires the newest version of Token Magic FX and libwrapper, but they will be installed alongside it automatically. To use animations included in the free module, you don't have to do anything more—they will be automagically configured.

If you buy any of the assets on the Forge, the module will automagically pick them up and map spells for them—no action required!
